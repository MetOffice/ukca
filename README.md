UKCA (United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosols Project) is a joint NCAS-Met Office
programme part of the NERC-Met Office Joint Climate and Weather Research
Programme (JWCRP). Project partners are the Hadley Centre and the Universities
of Cambridge, Leeds and Oxford. Our objective is to develop, evaluate and make
available a UK community atmospheric chemistry-aerosol model suitable for a
range of topics in climate and environmental change research.
